title: Setup
---

This lesson teaches the principles of reproducible containerised scientific workflows by means of
using [REANA](http://www.reana.io/) reproducible analysis platform.

The participants should either install [reana-client](https://pypi.org/project/reana-client/) or
should have access to CERN's LXPLUS environment.

Since the installation is short, we'll do that at the beginning of the lesson.
