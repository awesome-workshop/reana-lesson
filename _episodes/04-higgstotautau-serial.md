## Overview

We have practiced writing and running workflows on REANA using a simple RooFit analysis example.

In this lesson we shall go back to the HiggsToTauTau analysis used throughout this workshop and we
shall write a serial workflow to run the analysis on the REANA platform.

## Skimming workflow

Let us write a simple serial workflow to run skimming for one dataset, say TTbar.

## Full workflow

If time permits, you can write full workflow up to producing final plot.  The workflow will not be
efficient as it will work serially over various datasets; we shall speed it up in the forthcoming
[HiggsToTauTau analysis: parallel](../07-higgstotautau-parallel) lesson after the break.
