questions:
- "How to scale up and run thousands of jobs?"
objectives:
- "Learn about Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG)"

We now know how to develop reproducible analyses on small scale.

Need to scale-up for real life work -> parallel processing.

Many workflow engines; we are going to use Yadage.

Directed Acyclic Graph principles.

Validation.

Taking RooFit again (even though it is serial) and reading Yadage syntax.

Running the same example on REANA.  Was it necessary to change anything?

Exercise: Yadage parameter changing, Yadage syntax question.
