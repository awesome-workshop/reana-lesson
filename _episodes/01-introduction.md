Reproducibility problem. Definitions.

Preservation vs preproducibility.

Four questions: data? code? environment? runtime procedure?

Code and environment seen in previous lessons; good.

Now runtime procedures. Interactive/GUI no, scripts yes. Do you write run.sh? Glue Python code?

Porting glue code to adapt to different platform? Much work. Imperative to declarative.

Workflow systems. Different communities like different tools.

Birth of REANA to support multi-workflow multi-user multi-backend scenarios.

Lesson today to teach reproducible computational workflows via REANA.

Thinking excercise: containers enough to capture environment? what else in your typical physics scenarios?  (live DB calls, GT information, etc)
